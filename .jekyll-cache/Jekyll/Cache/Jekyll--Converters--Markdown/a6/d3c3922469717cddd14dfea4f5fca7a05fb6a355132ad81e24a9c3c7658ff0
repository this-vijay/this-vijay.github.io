<p>Mondays are Best for Flying out of Windows is inspired by the stories of Daniil Kharms (1905-1942), an early Soviet era absurdist poet, writer and dramatist. Kharms was often incarcerated by the Soviet regime for his unconventional and rebellious ways. His adult literature was not published during his lifetime and he was confined to writing for children. He is said to have starved to an anonymous death in the psychiatric ward of a Soviet hospital after his arrest in 1942.</p>

<p>Mondays are Best for Flying out of Windows was specially commissioned for the Serendipity Arts Festival and premiered in Panjim, Goa in December 2018.</p>

<p>From 2001 to 2003 I worked on and off at The Puppet Parlor, a tiny marionette theater in Chicago run by Ralph and Lou: two old puppeteers hailing from older vaudeville families.  They  had built more than 2000 wooden marionettes by hand, all stored in that cramped basement on Montrose Avenue, many dating back to the 1960’s when the theater had actually known some financial sucess.</p>

<p>Over the next few years I received training from these men, repainted and repaired dozens of old puppets, worked as a puppeteer during shows (including their adults-only midnight burlesque show), and watched audience after confused audience wonder what relic of the past they’d mistakenly stumbled into. The theater itself slipped further and further into debt, until tragically the entire building burned down in a freak accident in 2004.</p>

<p>Many years later I came to learn that  thousands of the old marionettes were found abandoned in a run-down apartment in Chicago.  It was thought to be the world’s largest collection of marionettes made by a single person!
<a href="https://theundergroundmultiplex.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/dear-chicago-would-you-like-to-make-world-headlines-for-something-other-than-murders-heres-how/">There was a campaign to rescue the marionettes,</a> but I’m not sure what finally became of it.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I feel  the saddest part was how there was no longer an audience for their stories or their art form, a fact that I don’t think Ralph or Lou ever managed to accept.</p>
