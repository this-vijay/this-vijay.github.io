<p>A trailer for our play <i>Mondays are best for flying out of windows</i>.
Not exactly animation, but I wanted to play  with the technique of moving a camera across a still graphic to tell a story.  Music by Abhaydev Praful.</p>

<p>I made this animated short in 2006, soon after a major storm had swept through the Northeastern United States causing the Sycamore tree near my residence to lose most of its upper branches.The morning after the storm I filled the trunk and back seat of my car with Sycamore detritus, not wanting it to go to waste (image-search ‚Äúsycamore‚Äù it and you will understand!).</p>

<p>One branch in particular bore a striking resemblance to Alces alces, otherwise known as the North American Moose.  And this unforeseen connection between a beloved mammal and a beloved tree resonated in my mind with the work of a beloved poet, Elizabeth Bishop.</p>

<p>This film was an attempt to connect it all.  It is retroactively dedicated to anyone who loves the Sycamore tree, the limbo of prolonged long-distance transportation, and of course the North American Moose.</p>
