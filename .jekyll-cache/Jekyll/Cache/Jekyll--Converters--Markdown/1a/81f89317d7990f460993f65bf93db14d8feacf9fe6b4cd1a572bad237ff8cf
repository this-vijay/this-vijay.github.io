'Mondays are Best for Flying out of Windows' is a play inspired by the stories of Daniil Kharms (1905-1942), an early Soviet era absurdist poet, writer and dramatist. Kharms was often incarcerated by the Soviet regime for his unconventional and rebellious ways. His adult literature was not published during his lifetime and he was confined to writing for children. He is said to have starved to an anonymous death in the psychiatric ward of a Soviet hospital after his arrest in 1942.

<p>In 2018 I received a grant from Perch Collective Chennai to create the performance â€˜Lentils and Stonesâ€™. The piece is partly based on my experience living with my grandmother over the past several years, during which Iâ€™ve been struck by the disproportionate number of stories that come from her childhood, and by how vividly she recounts and draws sustenance from these tales.  On the other hand, her childhood came to an abrupt end at age twelve when she was married off, and the vast majority of the life that followed is remembered in a very different way, always in relation to the domestic work she was engaged in.  At times while listening to her, the work feels like a sort of slavery, especially in the earlier stages of moving into her husbandâ€™s large joint family.  But the work eventually becomes an everyday reality that is accepted and unquestioned.  And in a world where the pace of social, political, and environmental change evades our capacity to keep up, her memory of that work provides a conflicted sense of comfort.</p>

<p>Some time back a friend read me the poem â€˜Woman Cleaning Lentilsâ€™ by the Armenian poet Zahrad, and I instantly fell in love with it.  The poem follows the abstracted thoughts of an old woman as she sorts stones from lentils, but the listener has to fill in all the gaps â€” the poem is more of a scaffold â€” which is perhaps why it feels so universal.  The abstraction of the poem also gives room for puppetry to become a powerful medium of storytelling, by giving a physical life to quite general themes, while still leaving room for the viewerâ€™s imagination to root it all in specific experiences.</p>

<p>â€˜Lentils and Stonesâ€™ was inspired by the poem â€˜Woman Cleaning Lentilsâ€™ by the Armenian poet Zahrad, and also by my time spent listening to my grandmother, noticing the past worlds we carry within ourselves with their uneasy relation to the present.  And the tussle between the past and present over who gets to have a final word.</p>

<p>In 2017 and 2018 I worked on masks and art for Madhushree Basuâ€™s play â€˜Maradhyanaâ€™, originally created for Gender Bender 2017.</p>

<h1 id="puppet-parlor-chicago">Puppet Parlor Chicago</h1>

<p>From 2001 to 2003 I worked on and off at The Puppet Parlor, a tiny marionette theater in Chicago run by Ralph and Lou: two old puppeteers hailing from older vaudeville families.  They  had built more than 2000 wooden marionettes by hand, all stored in that cramped basement on Montrose Avenue, many dating back to the 1960â€™s when the theater had actually known some financial sucess.</p>

</div>

<p>Over the next few years I received training from these men, repainted and repaired dozens of old puppets, worked as a puppeteer during shows (including their adults-only midnight burlesque show), and watched audience after confused audience wonder what relic of the past theyâ€™d mistakenly stumbled into. The theater itself slipped further and further into debt, until tragically the entire building burned down in a freak accident in 2004.</p>

<p>Many years later I came to learn that  thousands of the old marionettes were found abandoned in a run-down apartment in Chicago.  It was thought to be the worldâ€™s largest collection of marionettes made by a single person!
<a href="https://theundergroundmultiplex.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/dear-chicago-would-you-like-to-make-world-headlines-for-something-other-than-murders-heres-how/">There was a campaign to rescue the marionettes,</a> but Iâ€™m not sure what finally became of it.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I feel  the saddest part was how there was no longer an audience for their stories or their art form, a fact that I donâ€™t think Ralph or Lou ever managed to accept.</p>
