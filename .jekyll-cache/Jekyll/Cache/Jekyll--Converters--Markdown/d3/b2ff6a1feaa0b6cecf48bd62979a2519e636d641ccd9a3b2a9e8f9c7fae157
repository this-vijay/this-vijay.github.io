I"ª<p>Over the past few years I‚Äôve given a number of general audience talks for high school and college students.  I‚Äôm sharing a few below.</p>

<h2 id="geometry-of-vision">Geometry of vision</h2>

<p>Which of the following viewpoints of the tiled floor would be easiest to draw?</p>

<div class="pictures-container">

 <img src="../images/outreach/floor3_grid.jpg" class="shrinkToFit" height="150" />
</div>

<p>Surprisingly, the  third is easiest: you don‚Äôt need to take a single measurement,  in contrast to the first two!  In fact, all you need to draw it is your pencil and an <i>unmarked scale</i> (or <i>straightedge</i>) for connecting points.
You could  say this third viewpoint is actually in the most general position, demonstrated by the useful property that any set of parallel lines appears to converge to a  point at infinity!</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs the basic principle of perspective drawing:  parallel lines appear to converge in the distance. Looking at examples, it is easy to see that pictures drawn
‚Äúin perspective‚Äù correctly model our vision, while pictures that are
not drawn ‚Äúin perspective‚Äù fail to do so.  But why is this the case?
Namely, why is it that when we look at two  parallel lines in space, we
actually observe them converging to the same point?  And why do different
families of parallel lines seem to converge to different points?</p>

<p>This talk was partly based on  John Stillwell‚Äôs excellent book <i>The Four Pillars of Geometry</i>.</p>

<h2 id="in-search-of-a-lost-bicycle">In search of a lost bicycle</h2>
<p>Where has your bicycle gone?  You can see tracks in the mud, but which
direction are they going?  If you could only determine the direction
and follow the tracks, you just might find the bike itself.  But is it
even possible to do so?</p>

<p>I gave this talk in Tamil to 150 school students as part of the Tamil language  program <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/outreach/KK2018/"><i>kaNita-kAnakam</i></a> at IMSc. It was largely based onthe Math Circle Session
<a href="https://www.mathteacherscircle.org/wp-content/themes/mtc/assets/MATH-CIRCLE-SESSION_Bicycle-Tracks.pdf"><i>The Mathematics of Bicycle Tracks</i></a>
by James Tanton.</p>

<p>Gauss‚Äôs <i>Theorema Egregium</i> tells us that the sphere and the plane have
different <i>curvatures</i>, and as a consequence there can never be a
perfect map of the surface of the Earth. However, it is not hard to construct a map that preserves other important features of our
planet‚Äôs surface, such as local surface area, shortest path curves, or
angles of intersections of curves (i.e. <i>shape</i>).</p>

<p>Because of Gauss‚Äô Theorem, no map can accurately represent <i>both</i> area and shape.
Yet despite this obstruction, people have come up with remarkable innovations, including a tetrahedral Earth that can be ‚Äúunfolded‚Äù into an
infinitely repeating, center-less map of Earth.</p>

<h2 id="pascals-triangle-evened-out">Pascal‚Äôs Triangle evened out</h2>
<p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Pascal‚Äôs Triangle is how often it has appeared in different cultures and contexts and time periods. No person or society can claim ownership ‚Äì it is a truly human invention!</p>

<p>As with many mathematical objects, some of  the most interesting patterns in Pascal‚Äôs Triangle  emerge only when you ‚Äòforget‚Äô much of what you know about it.   To begin with, take a look at what happens when you examine just the odd entries of Pascal‚Äôs triangle.</p>

 <img src="../images/outreach/mod_2_32_rows.png" class="shrinkToFit" height="150" />
 
</div>

<p>And this is just the beginning ‚Äì using modular arithmetic you can discover even more families of ‚Äòself-similar‚Äô fractals residing within.</p>

<p>A  strip of paper and a bit of cello tape is all one needs to construct a <i>hexaflexagon</i>. Questions of a mathematical nature arise when you begin to examine the properties of your creation. And the answers to these questions may lead to new construction ideas!</p>
