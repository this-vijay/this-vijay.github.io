news portal <a href="http://www.tnlabour.in">Thozhilalar Koodam</a>.

Here is a selection of my work.

<h3><i>A factory fire in Delhi</i> (March 2020)</h3>


At around 5 AM on 8th December, 2019, a massive fire broke out in a luggage factory in the Anaj Mandi neighborhood of Delhi.  Over one hundred workers were sleeping on the upper floors of the factory when the fire broke out, and found themselves trapped inside. The factory had been operating illegally without fire escapes, and the terrace door had been bolted shut. Many of the 59 workers rescued by the fire department suffered serious burn injuries. The remaining 43 workers perished in the flames. One of these 43 workers, Musharraf Ali, managed to call his best friend Shobhit (Monu) Aggarwal moments before he died.  His phone call was recorded and briefly became a sensation in Indian media.


The following graphic, <a href="https://www.groundxero.in/2020/03/12/the-aadamkhors/"> first published in groundxero,</a> illustrates a poem by the actor Sushant Singh which was inspired by this tragedy, and in particular by Musharraf and Shobit’s final conversation.

It was translated into English by Sushmita and into Tamil by Muthuvel.  It was later <a href="https://mehnatkash.in/2020/03/22/chitra-katha-this-fire-must-be-extinguished/"> published in Hindi in Mehnatkash </a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/v16tecWv9ws"> adapted to a video in Tamil narrated by Anandsami </a>, and finally <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WorkersUnity18/videos/734319700710547/"> adapted to a video in Hindi, narrated by the actor and poet  Sushant Singh. </a>

<h3><i>Media bias in the MTC bus strike</i> (January 2018)</h3>

<a href="http://tnlabour.in/news/6302">The MTC went on strike for eight days in January, 2018.</a>
This graphic was made with Thozhilalar Koodam
in solidarity with the the striking bus drivers and
highlights the media bias in coverage. I also wanted to emphasize the importance of workers reaching
out to the public for support.

<h3><i>Newsletter cover image</i> (January 2018)</h3>
From November 27th to 29th, 2017, Tamilnadu nurses went on strike over their abysmal working conditions and salaries.
During the resulting public interest litigation, the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court revealed her disdain
for the striking nurses, embodying the ensconced sense of power and privilege of the ruling classes.

<h3><i>A conversation after the strike</i> (December 2017)</h3>

This comic was based on a conversation that a member of Thozhilalar Koodam overheard following a strike.
<a href="../images/labour/extras/conversation_long_tamil.jpg">The Tamil version</a> was included in the January 2018
Thozhilalar Koodam Workers' Newsletter, and intended to stimulate further conversations and feedback
from workers.

<h3><i>You are not essential</i> (December 2017)</h3>
<p>This image was intended to bring out the hypocrisy in the prevailing argument
that providers of essential services cannot organize collectively or go on strike.
However, we decided this image can too easily be twisted to support
that very argument we were trying to counter, so I am still exploring an effective
way of graphically conveying this somewhat subtle idea.</p>

<h3><i>Newsletter cover image</i> (October 2017)</h3>
<p>In this cover for the Thozhilalar Koodam Workers' Newsletter,
we critique the media coverage of some of the initiatives of the Modi government that have
been disastrous for the working class.  In particular, we linked demonetization and GST
with the labour reforms currently being pushed through.

<h3><i>Life goes on for the Mahagun Modernes of the world</i> (July 2017)</h3>
<p>This image was drawn in the wake of the Zohra Bibi story, which made headlines even in the mainstream press.
In the image, workers assume precarious positions to put up a new 'Mahagun Moderne' billboard above a busy road.
Meanwhile on the ground, police harass a street vendor, oblivious to the hazardous conditions of the
workers above.
Yet, despite this bleak status quo, the Zohra Bibi story reminds us of the immense potential for
worker solidarity and militancy brimming beneath the surface.</p>

<h3><i>The Story of the Garment Workers' Wage</i> (November, 2016)</h3>
<p>
On July 13, 2016, the Tamilnadu High Court ordered garment factories in and around Chennai
to uphold the minimum wage for garment workers,
overturning stay orders that had kept the wage stagnant for years.
This mandate did not appear out of nowhere, but was the culmination of years of struggle by labour union activists,
including the Garment and Fashion Workers Union (GAFWU), an independent trade union affiliated to NTUI.
<a href="http://tnlabour.in/factory-workers/4387">Thozhilalar Koodam teamed up with GAFWU</a> to make short comic explaining the struggle and its current objectives.
The comic was printed in Tamil and distributed to garment workers by GAFWU as part of a campaign.

<h3><i>Why We Need a Minimum Wage Law</i> (March 2016)</h3>
<p>
A strong minimum wage law is an expression of worker solidarity across employment sector,
region, ethnicity, caste, and gender.  It is also a core demand of the labour movement.    
In order to better understand this fight,
<a href="http://tnlabour.in/workers-struggles/3448">Thozhilalar Koodam created a comic</a> on the Minimum Wages Act of 1948: how it is used, abused,
and how it can better serve the interests of the working class.
