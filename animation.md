## The Aadamkhors



{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId4 %}


At around 5 AM on 8th December, 2019, a massive fire broke out in a
luggage factory in the Anaj Mandi neighborhood of Delhi.  Over one
hundred workers were sleeping on the upper floors of the factory when
the fire broke out, and found themselves trapped inside. The factory
had been operating illegally without fire escapes, and the terrace
door had been bolted shut. Many of the 59 workers rescued by the fire
department suffered serious burn injuries. The remaining 43 workers
perished in the flames. One of these 43 workers, Musharraf Ali,
managed to call his best friend Shobhit (Monu) Aggarwal moments before
he died.  His phone call was recorded and briefly became a sensation
in Indian media.

This is a short animation of a poem written by
the actor Sushant Singh, who is from the same town as Shobhit.  The poem was
inspired by this tragedy, and in particular by Musharraf and Shobhit’s final conversation.
 It was translated to Tamil by Muthuvel, and is performed here by Anandsami.

## The Moose

A short animation inspired by ‘The Moose’ – a poem by Elizabeth Bishop.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId1 %}

I made this animated short in 2006, soon after a major storm had swept through the Northeastern United States causing the Sycamore tree near my residence to lose most of its upper branches.The morning after the storm I filled the trunk and back seat of my car with Sycamore detritus, not wanting it to go to waste (image-search “sycamore” it and you will understand!).

One branch in particular bore a striking resemblance to Alces alces, otherwise known as the North American Moose.  And this unforeseen connection between a beloved mammal and a beloved tree resonated in my mind with the work of a beloved poet, Elizabeth Bishop.

This film was an attempt to connect it all.  It is retroactively dedicated to anyone who loves the Sycamore tree, the limbo of prolonged long-distance transportation, and of course the North American Moose.
