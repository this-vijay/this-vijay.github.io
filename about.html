<p>
I was born and raised in the US, where I grew up in the midwest, before moving to the east coast for college and later graduate school.
</p>

  <p>
After completing a PhD in mathematics in 2013, I moved to Bombay, India, to work as a mathematician.

    <p>
Relocating to Chennai in 2015 I started doing illustrations and posters for a few organizations whose work I found inspiring, and also conducting a drawing class for kids in the fishing village near where I stay.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later, in 2017, I started making masks and puppets for performances, and in 2018 received a grant to create a performance of my own.  That has since led to more performances, collaborations, and to the launching of ikkarai, a community arts organization aimed at creating performance infused with puppetry, poetry, and dance.
