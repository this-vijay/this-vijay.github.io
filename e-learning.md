Since June 2020 I've been creating content for online education.  

I am currently working on a series of courses for NPTEL, the open access online course portal run by the Ministry of Education.

Prior to this, I worked for the company <a href="https://www.cuemath.com">Cuemath</a>, designing a new model for interactive math sessions, which combine storytelling, professional actors, animation, and practical yet surprising mathematics that is not typically found in textbooks.  You can scroll down to see some examples.

## <i>Our Mathematical Senses</i>


{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId1 %}


This is the trailer for an online course, <a href="https://this-vijay.github.io/vision-math/"><i>The Geometry of Vision</i></a>, which I created for NPTEL.  The course examines the math through which we make visual sense of the world around us.  Somehow we are able to construct an intricate 3D understanding of our surroundings from 2D visual snapshots, and in order to do this our brain calls upon various deep, elegant, and ancient mathematical principles.

I’ve attempted to value learners’ time and keep them engaged by creating a <a href="https://this-vijay.github.io/vision-math/">'scrollable', interactive, e-book format</a>, designed with Aatish Bhatia.  Learners can scroll through a given lecture, watching short, visually engaging videos interspersed with interactive questions, activities, and graphics.

In addition to keeping the lecture videos short and succinct, we’ve also created high production intro videos to each ‘chapter’ which motivate the big ideas of the week, and weave them into a broader narrative.  These videos include special effects, animation, and even professional actors.

 Following <i>Geometry of Vision</i>, I plan to create subsequent minicourses: <i>The Topology of Movement</i>, and <i>The Structure of Sound</i>.  Once they're all up, students can take them together as a semester-long course, <i>Our Mathematical Senses</i>.

As part of NPTEL, the online course platform run by the Ministry of Education, these courses are open access, and freely available 
for anyone to use.  In fact, any student at any Indian college or university can take them for credit.

## <i>The Math of Voting</i> (created for <i>Cuemath</i>)


The mayor is back in <a href="https://this-vijay.github.io/voting-math/">this interactive module</a>, and he's more distressed than ever! This time he's facing sleepness nights due to the upcoming mayoral election. While he is happy to retire from his post, he's deeply suspicious of the two polarizing candidates, and he would like to devise a mathematically perfect voting system before his term ends.



As the mayor struggles with this formidable task, he begins receiving late-night visitations from the Three Election Ghosts!

The Ghost of Elections Past explains how our historical system of counting votes has made it easy for politicians to win elections without winning the popular vote.

The Ghost of Elections Present reveals how present day politicians redraw district boundaries (a practice known as gerrymandering) in order to game election outcomes.

The Ghost of Elections Yet to Come describes some fairer alternatives to our current 'plurality voting' system such as
ranked voting and score voting.

While pondering these alternate voting systems, the mayor discovers the Condorcet Paradox and Arrow's Theorem.  In the end, there is no perfect voting system, but we can still use mathematics to make our systems fairer and more democratic.

## <i>Math of COVID-19: Face Masks and Social Distancing</i>

<a href="https://this-vijay.github.io/more-covid-math/">This interactive module</a>  reviews exponential growth and the parameter <i>R</i>-nought, and explores two ways of reducing <i>R</i>-nought to slow the spread of the pandemic: mask-wearing and social distancing.  

In their journey to help bring the pandemic to an end, the player will encounter:

a mayor on the verge of nervous breakdown due to the unpredicatability of the pandemic <i>infection tree</i>,

## <i>Math of COVID-19: Understanding Exponential Growth</i>

<a href="https://this-vijay.github.io/covid-math/">This interactive module</a> examines how quickly a pandemic can spread, by introducing exponential growth, the quantity <i>R</i>-nought, and logarithmic scales.
