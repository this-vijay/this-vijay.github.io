The importance of stories is not just that they seem to preserve the past, but that they disturb the present. And there is something inherently disturbing but captivating in the medium of puppet theater. A means to puncture reality – playing with the notion of bringing the inert alive – and yet holding human reality by its tail, telling tales that human mouths are not quite able to utter.
